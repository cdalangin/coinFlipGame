This is for a Codecademy Independent project where I have to make a console application 
that allows the user to guess the outcome of a random coin flip.

Basic Requirements
✅ User Story: As a user I want to be able to guess the outcome of a random coin flip(heads/tails).
✅ User Story: As a user I want to clearly see the result of the coin flip.
✅ User Story: As a user I want to clearly see whether or not I guessed correctly.

Additional Challenges
❌ User Story: As a user I want to clearly see the updated guess history (correct count/total count).
❌ User Story: As a user I want to be able to quit the game or go again after each cycle.
