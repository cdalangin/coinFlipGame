## What's this?
This is for a Codecademy Independent project where I have to make a console application <br> 
that allows the user to guess the outcome of a random coin flip. <br>

## Basic Requirements
✅ User Story: As a user I want to be able to guess the outcome of a random coin flip(heads/tails). <br>
✅ User Story: As a user I want to clearly see the result of the coin flip. <br>
✅ User Story: As a user I want to clearly see whether or not I guessed correctly. <br>

## Additional Challenges
❌ User Story: As a user I want to clearly see the updated guess history (correct count/total count). <br>
❌ User Story: As a user I want to be able to quit the game or go again after each cycle.
